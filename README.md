Most monitors can support two or three additional monitors. The number of monitors a laptop can support depends on the operating system it is running, the graphics card, and the number of available ports on the device, as well as the additional equipment you are willing to purchase.

## How Many Monitors Can a Laptop Support?

While most laptops can support several additional monitors, each individual laptop will have its own limitations. Older laptops will have less powerful hardware components. These will not support as many monitors. The ports will also be obsolete.

Newer laptops may have better hardware but fewer ports. Lots of laptops these days are built to be small and sleek. To accommodate lightweight bodies, laptop manufacturers often remove extra ports and internal hardware.
